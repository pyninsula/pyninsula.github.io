        Code of Conduct
    </h2>
    <p>Pyninsula is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
age or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in the meetup,
including talks.
Pyninsula participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
expelled from the venue at the discretion of the meetup organizers.</p>
<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.</li>
<li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
<li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
<li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Pyninsula welcomes its younger members.
Please keep all interaction to PG-13,
as this is a family-friendly venue.</p>
<div class="section" id="enforcement">
<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour,
event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a
welcoming environment for all participants.
This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup.</p>
<p>Meetup organisers may take action to redress anything designed to,
or with the clear impact of,
disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all meetup venues and
meetup-related social activities.
We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reporting">
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome,
please report it as soon as possible.
Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event
for everyone.
We want you to be happy at our event.
People like you make our event a better place.</p>
<p>You can make a report either personally or anonymously.</p>
<div class="section" id="anonymous-report">
<h3>Anonymous Report</h3>
<p>You can make an <a class="reference external" href="https://goo.gl/forms/aDUSUvM8epVSip1z1">anonymous report</a>.</p>
<p>We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly,
but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary
to prevent a recurrence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="personal-report">
<h3>Personal Report</h3>
<p>You can make a personal report by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>E-mailing <a class="reference external" href="mailto:zadka.moshe&#64;gmail.com">zadka.moshe&#64;gmail.com</a></li>
<li>Contacting an organizer: Mahmoud Hashemi, Moshe Zadka, Mark Williams or Kurt Rose</li>
</ul>
<p>When taking a personal report,
we will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard.
We may involve other organizers to ensure your report is managed properly.
Once safe,
we'll ask you to tell us about what happened.
This can be upsetting,
but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible,
and you can bring someone to support you.
At no point will you be asked to confront anyone and
at no point, unless you ask us to, will we tell anyone who you are.</p>
<p>Our team will be happy to help you contact venue security,
local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts,
or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event.
We value your attendance.</p>
